After a terrifying forest fire in Berland a forest rebirth program was carried out. Due to it N rows with M trees each were planted and the rows were so neat that one could map it on a system of coordinates so that the j-th tree in the i-th row would have the coordinates of (i, j). However a terrible thing happened and the young forest caught fire. Now we must find the coordinates of the tree that will catch fire last to plan evacuation.

The burning began in K points simultaneously, which means that initially K trees started to burn. Every minute the fire gets from the burning trees to the ones that aren’t burning and that the distance from them to the nearest burning tree equals to 1.

Find the tree that will be the last to start burning. If there are several such trees, output any.
