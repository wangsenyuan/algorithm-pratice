Alice and Bob are playing a game.

They start with a positive integer 𝑛
 and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from 𝑛
 one of its divisors that isn't 1
 or 𝑛
. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.

Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.

You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.
