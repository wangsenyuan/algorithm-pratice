Medicine faculty of Berland State University has just finished their admission campaign. As usual, about 80%
of applicants are girls and majority of them are going to live in the university dormitory for the next 4
(hopefully) years.

The dormitory consists of 𝑛
rooms and a single mouse! Girls decided to set mouse traps in some rooms to get rid of the horrible monster. Setting a
trap in room number 𝑖
costs 𝑐𝑖
burles. Rooms are numbered from 1
to 𝑛
.

Mouse doesn't sit in place all the time, it constantly runs. If it is in room 𝑖
in second 𝑡
then it will run to room 𝑎𝑖
in second 𝑡+1
without visiting any other rooms inbetween (𝑖=𝑎𝑖
means that mouse won't leave room 𝑖
). It's second 0
in the start. If the mouse is in some room with a mouse trap in it, then the mouse get caught into this trap.

That would have been so easy if the girls actually knew where the mouse at. Unfortunately, that's not the case, mouse
can be in any room from 1
to 𝑛
at second 0
.

What it the minimal total amount of burles girls can spend to set the traps in order to guarantee that the mouse will
eventually be caught no matter the room it started from?
