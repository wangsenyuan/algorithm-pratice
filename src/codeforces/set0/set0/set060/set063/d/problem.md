A revolution took place on the Buka Island. New government replaced the old one. The new government includes n parties and each of them is entitled to some part of the island according to their contribution to the revolution. However, they can't divide the island.

The island can be conventionally represented as two rectangles a × b and c × d unit squares in size correspondingly. The rectangles are located close to each other. At that, one of the sides with the length of a and one of the sides with the length of c lie on one line. You can see this in more details on the picture.


The i-th party is entitled to a part of the island equal to xi unit squares. Every such part should fully cover several squares of the island (it is not allowed to cover the squares partially) and be a connected figure. A "connected figure" presupposes that from any square of this party one can move to any other square of the same party moving through edge-adjacent squares also belonging to that party.

Your task is to divide the island between parties.
