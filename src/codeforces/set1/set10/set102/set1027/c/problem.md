You have 𝑛
 sticks of the given lengths.

Your task is to choose exactly four of them in such a way that they can form a rectangle. No sticks can be cut to pieces, each side of the rectangle must be formed by a single stick. No stick can be chosen multiple times. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to choose such sticks.

Let 𝑆
 be the area of the rectangle and 𝑃
 be the perimeter of the rectangle.

The chosen rectangle should have the value 𝑃2𝑆
 minimal possible. The value is taken without any rounding.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Each testcase contains several lists of sticks, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.
