Ranom digits are denoted by uppercase Latin letters from A to E. Moreover, the value of the letter A is 1
, B is 10
, C is 100
, D is 1000
, E is 10000
.

A Ranom number is a sequence of Ranom digits. The value of the Ranom number is calculated as follows: the values of all
digits are summed up, but some digits are taken with negative signs: a digit is taken with negative sign if there is a
digit with a strictly greater value to the right of it (not necessarily immediately after it); otherwise, that digit is
taken with a positive sign.

For example, the value of the Ranom number DAAABDCA is 1000−1−1−1−10+1000+100+1=2088
.

You are given a Ranom number. You can change no more than one digit in it. Calculate the maximum possible value of the
resulting number.
