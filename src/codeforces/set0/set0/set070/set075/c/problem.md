Well, here is another math class task. In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to
calculate the GCD between two positive integers.

A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.

But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisor d between
two integers a and b that is in a given range from low to high (inclusive), i.e. low ≤ d ≤ high. It is possible that
there is no common divisor in the given range.

You will be given the two integers a and b, then n queries. Each query is a range from low to high and you have to
answer each query.

### ideas

1. gcd(a, b) 可以先算出来吗？
2. 然后再二分查找？
