Berland has n cities, some of them are connected by bidirectional roads. For each road we know whether it is asphalted or not.

The King of Berland Valera II wants to asphalt all roads of Berland, for that he gathered a group of workers. Every day Valera chooses exactly one city and orders the crew to asphalt all roads that come from the city. The valiant crew fulfilled the King's order in a day, then workers went home.

Unfortunately, not everything is as great as Valera II would like. The main part of the group were gastarbeiters — illegal immigrants who are enthusiastic but not exactly good at understanding orders in Berlandian. Therefore, having received orders to asphalt the roads coming from some of the city, the group asphalted all non-asphalted roads coming from the city, and vice versa, took the asphalt from the roads that had it.

Upon learning of this progress, Valera II was very upset, but since it was too late to change anything, he asked you to make a program that determines whether you can in some way asphalt Berlandian roads in at most n days. Help the king.
