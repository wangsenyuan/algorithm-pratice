Valera takes part in the Berland Marathon. The marathon race starts at the stadium that can be represented on the plane
as a square whose lower left corner is located at point with coordinates (0, 0) and the length of the side equals a
meters. The sides of the square are parallel to coordinate axes.

As the length of the marathon race is very long, Valera needs to have extra drink during the race. The coach gives
Valera a bottle of drink each d meters of the path. We know that Valera starts at the point with coordinates (0, 0) and
runs counter-clockwise. That is, when Valera covers a meters, he reaches the point with coordinates (a, 0). We also know
that the length of the marathon race equals nd + 0.5 meters.

Help Valera's coach determine where he should be located to help Valera. Specifically, determine the coordinates of
Valera's positions when he covers d, 2·d, ..., n·d meters.
