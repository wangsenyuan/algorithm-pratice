First of all, in this problem, we assume that the "bit" is 0-indexed. In other words, starting from the least significant digit in binary representation, we refer to them as 0-bit, 1-bit, and so on.

We want to find the answer for each bit separately. Let's say we want to find the value of the k-th bit. According to the definition of XOR, we need to determine whether there are an even or odd number of terms among N^2 pairs of ai + bj where the k-th bit is 1.

An important observation here is that since we're considering the k-th bit of ai + bj, we can ignore the bits of ai and bj beyond the k + 1-th bit. In other words, we can take the modulo of ai and bj by 2^(k+1), and this won't affect our analysis.

Now, ai + bj is at most 4T (where T = 2^k). The range of values where the k-th bit is 1 is [T, 2T), [3T, 4T), [5T, 6T), and so on. So, we need to count the number of ai + bj values within the ranges [T, 2T), [3T, 4T), and so on.

To achieve this, we can fix ai and then count the number of bj values within the ranges [T - ai, 2T - ai), [3T - ai, 4T - ai), and so on. This count can be obtained using binary search on a sorted list of bj values, resulting in an O(logN) complexity.

As a side note, the O(N^2) solution for this problem is very straightforward and can be significantly accelerated using Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) techniques. The problem's writer tested a direct O(N^2) solution with block processing, which took 3770ms. This suggests that individuals skilled in SIMD programming might even be able to pass the straightforward solution, so it's worth considering for those proficient in SIMD techniques.
