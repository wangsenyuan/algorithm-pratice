In his favorite cafe Kmes once again wanted to try the herring under a fur coat. Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.

Now, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: 𝑛
 cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the 𝑖
-th card there is an integer 𝑎𝑖
, among these prices there is no whole positive integer 𝑥
.

Kmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number of bad segments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is considered bad if it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to 𝑥
. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must be bad.

Formally, the segment (𝑙,𝑟)
 is bad if there are no indices 𝑖1<𝑖2<…<𝑖𝑘
 such that 𝑙≤𝑖1,𝑖𝑘≤𝑟
, and 𝑎𝑖1⋅𝑎𝑖2…⋅𝑎𝑖𝑘=𝑥
.

Help Kmes determine the minimum number of bad segments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.
