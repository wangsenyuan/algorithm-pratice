There are 𝑛
 boxers, the weight of the 𝑖
-th boxer is 𝑎𝑖
. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​𝑎𝑖
 will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001
 (but no more).
