You are given a tree with 𝑛
 nodes, rooted at node 1
. In this problem, a leaf is a non-root node with degree 1
.

In one operation, you can remove a leaf and the edge adjacent to it (possibly, new leaves appear). What is the minimum number of operations that you have to perform to get a tree, also rooted at node 1
, where all the leaves are at the same distance from the root?
