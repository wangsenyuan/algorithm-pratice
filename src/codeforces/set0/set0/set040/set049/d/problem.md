Vasya and Petya have invented a new game. Vasya takes a stripe consisting of 1 × n square and paints the squares black
and white. After that Petya can start moves — during a move he may choose any two neighboring squares of one color and
repaint these two squares any way he wants, perhaps in different colors. Petya can only repaint the squares in white and
black colors. Petya’s aim is to repaint the stripe so that no two neighboring squares were of one color. Help Petya,
using the given initial coloring, find the minimum number of moves Petya needs to win.
