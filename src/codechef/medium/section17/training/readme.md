Cricket is almost like a religion in India and many young kids attend coaching camps every year. This year there are total N kids at the camp and the coach is forming teams so that kids within a team can practice and compete with each other. As we know that kids are afraid of tall and heavy persons, they are afraid to get in to a team having such player. More formally, kid A is afraid of another kid B if weight(A) ≤ weight(B) and height(A) ≤ height(B). You can assume that no two kids have both height and weight equal to each other. Here is how the teams are formed by the coach.
All the N students are lined up. For R = 1,2,3,... in order, in the Rth round the coach calls all the students who are not afraid of any one in the line. They all come forward, form a team number R and leave for practice. This process is repeated as long as there are kids still in the line, yet to form a team. Given the height and weight of each of the N students, find the number of teams formed and the number of kids in each of them.
