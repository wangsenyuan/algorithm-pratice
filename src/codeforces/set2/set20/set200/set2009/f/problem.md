Firefly is given an array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
. Let 𝑐𝑖
 denote the 𝑖
'th cyclic shift∗
 of 𝑎
. She creates a new array 𝑏
 such that 𝑏=𝑐1+𝑐2+⋯+𝑐𝑛
 where +
 represents concatenation†
.

Then, she asks you 𝑞
 queries. For each query, output the sum of all elements in the subarray of 𝑏
 that starts from the 𝑙
-th element and ends at the 𝑟
-th element, inclusive of both ends.

### ideas
1. just brute force smartly
