Vasya has gotten interested in programming contests in TCMCF+++ rules. On the contest n problems were suggested and
every problem had a cost â€” a certain integral number of points (perhaps, negative or even equal to zero). According to
TCMCF+++ rules, only accepted problems can earn points and the overall number of points of a contestant was equal to the
product of the costs of all the problems he/she had completed. If a person didn't solve anything, then he/she didn't
even appear in final standings and wasn't considered as participant. Vasya understood that to get the maximal number of
points it is not always useful to solve all the problems. Unfortunately, he understood it only after the contest was
finished. Now he asks you to help him: find out what problems he had to solve to earn the maximal number of points.
