You are given an array 𝑎
 consisting of 𝑛
 integers.

You can remove at most one element from this array. Thus, the final length of the array is 𝑛−1
 or 𝑛
.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the remaining array.

Recall that the contiguous subarray 𝑎
 with indices from 𝑙
 to 𝑟
 is 𝑎[𝑙…𝑟]=𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑙+1,…,𝑎𝑟
. The subarray 𝑎[𝑙…𝑟]
 is called strictly increasing if 𝑎𝑙<𝑎𝑙+1<⋯<𝑎𝑟
.
