The Berland Army is preparing for a large military parade. It is already decided that the soldiers participating in it will be divided into𝑘
rows, and all rows will contain the same number of soldiers.

Of course, not every arrangement of soldiers into𝑘
rows is suitable. Heights of all soldiers in the same row should not differ by more than1
. The height of each soldier is an integer between1
and𝑛
.

For each possible height, you know the number of soldiers having this height. To conduct a parade, you have to choose the soldiers participating in it, and then arrange all of the chosen soldiers into𝑘
rows so that both of the following conditions are met:

each row has the same number of soldiers,
no row contains a pair of soldiers such that their heights differ by2
or more.
Calculate the maximum number of soldiers who can participate in the parade.
