Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are too complicated for him — his keyboard will consist of only one row, where all 26
 lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.

Polycarp uses the same password 𝑠
 on all websites where he is registered (it is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in 𝑠
, they should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is abacaba, then the layout cabdefghi... is perfect, since characters a and c are adjacent on the keyboard, and a and b are adjacent on the keyboard. It is guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in 𝑠
, so, for example, the password cannot be password (two characters s are adjacent).

Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it is possible?
