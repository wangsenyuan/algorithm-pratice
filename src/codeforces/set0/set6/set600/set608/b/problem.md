Genos needs your help. He was asked to solve the following programming problem by Saitama:

The length of some string s is denoted |s|. The Hamming distance between two strings s and t of equal length is defined as , where si is the i-th character of s and ti is the i-th character of t. For example, the Hamming distance between string "0011" and string "0110" is |0 - 0| + |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Given two binary strings a and b, find the sum of the Hamming distances between a and all contiguous substrings of b of length |a|.
