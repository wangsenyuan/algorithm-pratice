You are the head of a large enterprise. 𝑛
 people work at you, and 𝑛
 is odd (i. e. 𝑛
 is not divisible by 2
).

You have to distribute salaries to your employees. Initially, you have 𝑠
 dollars for it, and the 𝑖
-th employee should get a salary from 𝑙𝑖
 to 𝑟𝑖
 dollars. You have to distribute salaries in such a way that the median salary is maximum possible.

To find the median of a sequence of odd length, you have to sort it and take the element in the middle position after sorting. For example:

the median of the sequence [5,1,10,17,6]
 is 6
,
the median of the sequence [1,2,1]
 is 1
.
It is guaranteed that you have enough money to pay the minimum salary, i.e 𝑙1+𝑙2+⋯+𝑙𝑛≤𝑠
.

Note that you don't have to spend all your 𝑠
 dollars on salaries.

You have to answer 𝑡
 test cases.
