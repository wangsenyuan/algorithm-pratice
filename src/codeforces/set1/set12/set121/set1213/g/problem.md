You are given a weighted tree consisting of 𝑛
 vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices 𝑢𝑖
 and 𝑣𝑖
 are connected by an edge with weight 𝑤𝑖
.

You are given 𝑚
 queries. The 𝑖
-th query is given as an integer 𝑞𝑖
. In this query you need to calculate the number of pairs of vertices (𝑢,𝑣)
 (𝑢<𝑣
) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between 𝑢
 and 𝑣
 doesn't exceed 𝑞𝑖
.
