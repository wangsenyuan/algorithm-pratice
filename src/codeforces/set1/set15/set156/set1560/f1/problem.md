It is a simplified version of problem F2. The difference between them is the constraints (F1: 𝑘≤2
, F2: 𝑘≤10
).

You are given an integer 𝑛
. Find the minimum integer 𝑥
 such that 𝑥≥𝑛
 and the number 𝑥
 is 𝑘
-beautiful.

A number is called 𝑘
-beautiful if its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than 𝑘
 different digits. E.g. if 𝑘=2
, the numbers 3434443
, 55550
, 777
 and 21
 are 𝑘
-beautiful whereas the numbers 120
, 445435
 and 998244353
 are not.
