Sakurako has a box with 𝑛
 balls. Each ball has it's value. She wants to bet with her friend that if the friend randomly picks two balls from the box (it could be two distinct balls, but they may have the same value), the product of their values will be the same as the number that Sakurako guessed.

Since Sakurako has a PhD in probability, she knows that the best number to pick is the expected value, but she forgot how to calculate it. Help Sakurako and find the expected value of the product of two elements from the array.

It can be shown that the expected value has the form 𝑃𝑄
, where 𝑃
 and 𝑄
 are non-negative integers, and 𝑄≠0
. Report the value of 𝑃⋅𝑄−1(mod109+7)
.
