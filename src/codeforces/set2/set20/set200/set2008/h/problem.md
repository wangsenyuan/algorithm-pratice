Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers 𝑛
 and a task on it:

Given an integer 𝑥
, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an integer 𝑖
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛
) such that 𝑎𝑖≥𝑥
;
Change the value of 𝑎𝑖
 to 𝑎𝑖−𝑥
.
Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median∗
 of the array 𝑎
.

Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer 𝑥
. Someone let it slip that one of the 𝑞
 values of 𝑥
 will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such 𝑥
.
