One Big Software Company has n employees numbered from 1 to n. The director is assigned number 1. Every employee of the company except the director has exactly one immediate superior. The director, of course, doesn't have a superior.

We will call person a a subordinates of another person b, if either b is an immediate supervisor of a, or the immediate supervisor of a is a subordinate to person b. In particular, subordinates of the head are all other employees of the company.

To solve achieve an Important Goal we need to form a workgroup. Every person has some efficiency, expressed by a positive integer ai, where i is the person's number. The efficiency of the workgroup is defined as the total efficiency of all the people included in it.

The employees of the big software company are obsessed with modern ways of work process organization. Today pair programming is at the peak of popularity, so the workgroup should be formed with the following condition. Each person entering the workgroup should be able to sort all of his subordinates who are also in the workgroup into pairs. In other words, for each of the members of the workgroup the number of his subordinates within the workgroup should be even.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible efficiency of the workgroup formed at observing the given condition. Any person including the director of company can enter the workgroup.

1. 要加入u，u的子树中的节点，必须正好有偶数个已经加入了
2. dp[u][0/1] 0表示u未加入时的最大值，1表示u加入时的最大值
3. 然后如何计算dp[u][0/1]?
4. dp[u][0] 表示u不加入进去，那么似乎对v没有要求？但是v中加入的数量，反过来会影响到上层节点的处理（虽然对u没有影响）
5. 所以dp[u][0]应该表示在u子树中包含了偶数个节点时的最大值（不管u有没有加入，但u肯定不会加入，因为u加入，必须要有奇数个节点）
6. dp[u][1]表示在u子树中包含奇数个节点时的最大值（显然u必须加入） 
7. dp[u][0] = sum of dp[v][0]， 然后用偶数个 dp[v][1] - dp[v][0]去替换即可
