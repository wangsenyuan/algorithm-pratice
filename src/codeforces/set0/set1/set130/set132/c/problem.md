A lot of people associate Logo programming language with turtle graphics. In this case the turtle moves along the straight line and accepts commands "T" ("turn around") and "F" ("move 1 unit forward").

You are given a list of commands that will be given to the turtle. You have to change exactly n commands from the list (one command can be changed several times). How far from the starting point can the turtle move after it follows all the commands of the modified list?
