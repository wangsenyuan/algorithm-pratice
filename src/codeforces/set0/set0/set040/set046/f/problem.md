Today you are to solve the problem even the famous Hercule Poirot can't cope with! That's why this crime has not yet
been solved and this story was never included in Agatha Christie's detective story books.

You are not informed on what crime was committed, when and where the corpse was found and other details. We only know
that the crime was committed in a house that has n rooms and m doors between the pairs of rooms. The house residents are
very suspicious, that's why all the doors can be locked with keys and all the keys are different. According to the
provided evidence on Thursday night all the doors in the house were locked, and it is known in what rooms were the
residents, and what kind of keys had any one of them. The same is known for the Friday night, when all the doors were
also locked. On Friday it was raining heavily, that's why nobody left the house and nobody entered it. During the day
the house residents could

open and close doors to the neighboring rooms using the keys at their disposal (every door can be opened and closed from
each side);
move freely from a room to a room if a corresponding door is open;
give keys to one another, being in one room.
"Little grey matter" of Hercule Poirot are not capable of coping with such amount of information. Find out if the
positions of people and keys on the Thursday night could result in the positions on Friday night, otherwise somebody
among the witnesses is surely lying.
