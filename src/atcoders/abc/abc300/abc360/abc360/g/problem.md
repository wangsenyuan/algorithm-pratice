# Maximum LIS after One Change

You are given an integer sequence A of length N. Takahashi will perform the following operation exactly once:

Choose an integer x between 1 and N, inclusive, and an arbitrary integer y. Replace A_x with y.

Find the maximum possible length of a longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of A after performing the operation.
