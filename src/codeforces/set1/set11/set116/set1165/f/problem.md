Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are 𝑛
 types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs 2
 burles usually and 1
 burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly 𝑘𝑖
 microtransactions of the 𝑖
-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for 1
 burle and otherwise he can buy it for 2
 burles.

There are also 𝑚
 special offers in the game shop. The 𝑗
-th offer (𝑑𝑗,𝑡𝑗)
 means that microtransactions of the 𝑡𝑗
-th type are on sale during the 𝑑𝑗
-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.
