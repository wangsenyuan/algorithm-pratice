JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so that they don't get bored. Today the
problem is as follows. Given an integer 𝑛
, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:

mul 𝑥
: multiplies 𝑛
by 𝑥
(where 𝑥
is an arbitrary positive integer).
sqrt: replaces 𝑛
with 𝑛√
(to apply this operation, 𝑛√
must be an integer).
You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of 𝑛
, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?

Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?

### ideas

1. n = p1 * p2 * p3 ...
2. pi 是质数，那么那些偶数次的，可以被消除掉，但是奇数次的要被保留下来1个
