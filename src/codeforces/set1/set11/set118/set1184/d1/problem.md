The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel universes is "like travelling sideways". However, he incorrectly thought that there were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know, there will never be more than 250.

Heidi recently got her hands on a multiverse observation tool. She was able to see all 𝑛
 universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the 𝑘
-th universe.

The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed 𝑚
.

Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken.

More specifically,

When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends.
When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist.
Heidi wants to perform a simulation of 𝑡
 decisions. Each time a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse (i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor.

### ideas
1. 操作1， 增加一个新的universe的时候，如果它在doctor的前面，那么doctor的位置+1
2. 如果在doctor的后面，那么doctor的位置不变
3. 操作2，如果在doctor的前面，doctor的位置 - l, else不变
