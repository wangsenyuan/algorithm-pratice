You are given a positive integer 𝑛
. In one operation, you can add to 𝑛
 any positive integer whose decimal representation contains only the digit 9
, possibly repeated several times.

What is the minimum number of operations needed to make the number 𝑛
 contain at least one digit 7
 in its decimal representation?

For example, if 𝑛=80
, it is sufficient to perform one operation: you can add 99
 to 𝑛
, after the operation 𝑛=179
, which contains the digit 7
.
