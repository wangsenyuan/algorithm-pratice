William has a certain sequence of integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than 2⋅𝑛
 of the following questions:

What is the result of a bitwise AND of two items with indices 𝑖
 and 𝑗
 (𝑖≠𝑗
)
What is the result of a bitwise OR of two items with indices 𝑖
 and 𝑗
 (𝑖≠𝑗
)
You can ask William these questions and you need to find the 𝑘
-th smallest number of the sequence.

Formally the 𝑘
-th smallest number is equal to the number at the 𝑘
-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array [5,3,3,10,1]
 4
th smallest number is equal to 5
, and 2
nd and 3
rd are 3
.
