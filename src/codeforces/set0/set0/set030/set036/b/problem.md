Ever since Kalevitch, a famous Berland abstractionist, heard of fractals, he made them the main topic of his canvases. Every morning the artist takes a piece of graph paper and starts with making a model of his future canvas. He takes a square as big as n × n squares and paints some of them black. Then he takes a clean square piece of paper and paints the fractal using the following algorithm:

Step 1. The paper is divided into n2 identical squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.

Step 2. Every square that remains white is divided into n2 smaller squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.

Every following step repeats step 2.
