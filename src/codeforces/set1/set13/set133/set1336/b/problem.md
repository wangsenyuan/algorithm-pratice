Recently Xenia has bought nr
 red gems, ng
 green gems and nb
 blue gems. Each of the gems has a weight.

Now, she is going to pick three gems.

Xenia loves colorful things, so she will pick exactly one gem of each color.

Xenia loves balance, so she will try to pick gems with little difference in weight.

Specifically, supposing the weights of the picked gems are x
, y
 and z
, Xenia wants to find the minimum value of (x−y)2+(y−z)2+(z−x)2
. As her dear friend, can you help her?

### ideas
1. 在确定了z后，
2. (x-y)**2 + (y - z)**2 + (x - z) ** 2 最小
3. 那是不是就是最接近z的x和y的那几个？最多前面找3个，后面找3个？
