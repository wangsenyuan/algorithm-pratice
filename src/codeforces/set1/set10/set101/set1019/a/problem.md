As you know, majority of students and teachers of Summer Informatics School live in Berland for the most part of the
year. Since corruption there is quite widespread, the following story is not uncommon.

Elections are coming. You know the number of voters and the number of parties — 𝑛
and 𝑚
respectively. For each voter you know the party he is going to vote for. However, he can easily change his vote given a
certain amount of money. In particular, if you give 𝑖
-th voter 𝑐𝑖
bytecoins you can ask him to vote for any other party you choose.

The United Party of Berland has decided to perform a statistical study — you need to calculate the minimum number of
bytecoins the Party needs to spend to ensure its victory. In order for a party to win the elections, it needs to receive
strictly more votes than any other party.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers 𝑛
and 𝑚
(1≤𝑛,𝑚≤3000
) — the number of voters and the number of parties respectively.

Each of the following 𝑛
lines contains two integers 𝑝𝑖
and 𝑐𝑖
(1≤𝑝𝑖≤𝑚
, 1≤𝑐𝑖≤109
) — the index of this voter's preferred party and the number of bytecoins needed for him to reconsider his decision.

The United Party of Berland has the index 1
.
