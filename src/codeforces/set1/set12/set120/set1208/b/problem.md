You are given an array 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
. You can remove at most one subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.

In other words, at most one time you can choose two integers 𝑙
 and 𝑟
 (1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛
) and delete integers 𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑙+1,…,𝑎𝑟
 from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.

Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.
