To learn as soon as possible the latest news about their favourite fundamentally new operating system, BolgenOS
community from Nizhni Tagil decided to develop a scheme. According to this scheme a community member, who is the first
to learn the news, calls some other member, the latter, in his turn, calls some third member, and so on; i.e. a person
with index i got a person with index fi, to whom he has to call, if he learns the news. With time BolgenOS community
members understood that their scheme doesn't work sometimes â€” there were cases when some members didn't learn the news
at all. Now they want to supplement the scheme: they add into the scheme some instructions of type (xi, yi), which mean
that person xi has to call person yi as well. What is the minimum amount of instructions that they need to add so, that
at the end everyone learns the news, no matter who is the first to learn it?
