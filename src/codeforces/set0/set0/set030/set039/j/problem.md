Petya has noticed that when he types using a keyboard, he often presses extra buttons and adds extra letters to the words. Of course, the spell-checking system underlines the words for him and he has to click every word and choose the right variant. Petya got fed up with correcting his mistakes himself, thatâ€™s why he decided to invent the function that will correct the words itself. Petya started from analyzing the case that happens to him most of the time, when all one needs is to delete one letter for the word to match a word from the dictionary. Thus, Petya faces one mini-task: he has a printed word and a word from the dictionary, and he should delete one letter from the first word to get the second one. And now the very non-trivial question that Petya faces is: which letter should he delete?
