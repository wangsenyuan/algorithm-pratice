Given a tree∗
 with 𝑛
 vertices. You can choose two vertices 𝑎
 and 𝑏
 once and remove all vertices on the path from 𝑎
 to 𝑏
, including the vertices themselves. If you choose 𝑎=𝑏
, only one vertex will be removed.

Your task is to find the maximum number of connected components†
 that can be formed after removing the path from the tree.
