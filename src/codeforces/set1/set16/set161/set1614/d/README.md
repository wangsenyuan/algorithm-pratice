/**
* Super nice dp problem! Let's try to walkthrough this, as the tutorial really isn't good.
* Directly couting for permutations must be difficult, so we first observe that the chain
* of gcd looks sth like 12,12,6,2,2,1,1, where every num divides the previous one. Namely,
* g_i := gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_i) and we know g_i | g_i-1.
*
* So, regardless of len we use max_sum[t] to denote the maximum gcd prefixed sum that can
* be achieved with the last gcd being exactly t. Clearly we have to greedily include all
* multiples of t for max_sum[t], but how shall we order them?
* The key is, we wanna have the min num of "t"s and go to a t * k (k > 1) as soon as
* possible. So in our example, max_sum[1] would be 2 ones and the rest would be
* max_sum[2]. Again we may not know the num of elements included in max_sum[2], but we
* just know that we have to minimize ones and the rest is just stored in max_sum[2].
*
* This is a bit inaccurately though, since the gcd may not be exactly t but a multiple of
* it. Anyway, let's do it formally:
*      let max_sum[t] to be the maximum prefix gcd, in a certain order, for all
*      elements that are divisible by t (we don't restrict it to having gcd t).
*      Suppose that the prev num greater t is t', so all numbers divisible by t'
*      shall be placed at the front, i.e. it's optimal to make t' multiples
*      included in max_sum[t'], so naturally we have
*            max_sum[t] = max{ max_sum[t'] + #{ x : t|x but t'âˆ¤x } * t }   (t | t')
*                       = max{ max_sum[t'] + (#{x : t|x } - #{x : t'|x }) * t }
*      In the end, the answer is in max_sum[1] by definition.
* You may be curious about why the t in  max_sum[t] need not be the gcd. For example in
* {18, 12, 6, 7, 6} max_sum[6] = gcd(18)+gcd(18,12)+gcd(18,12,6)+gcd(18,12,6,6) = 36
* and max_sum[2] has the same value (36), though of course gcd(18,12,6,6) is 6. But anyway
* as we find max_sum[1], by which we include the 7, referecing to max_sum[6] yields a
* result larger than max_sum[2]. So everything fits!
*
* This already yields a O(A_MAX * log(A_MAX)) solution without sieve, but for D2 we have
* to go a bit further. Notice (again) that for a t | t', t' has at least 1 more prime
* divisor than t, so there exists prime p s.t. pt | t', which means max_sum[t'] is already
* "covered" by max_sum[pt]. Therefore, it suffices to iterate through all t' = tp. How
* brilliant!
* But wait, there's some impl details in the code comments. I think I've learnt loads from
* it.
*
* Time Complexity: (unable to determine)   (at least o(A_MAX * log(log(A_MAX))))
* Implementation 1
