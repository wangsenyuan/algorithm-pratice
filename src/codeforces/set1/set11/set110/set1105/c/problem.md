Ayoub had an array 𝑎
 of integers of size 𝑛
 and this array had two interesting properties:

All the integers in the array were between 𝑙
 and 𝑟
 (inclusive).
The sum of all the elements was divisible by 3
.
Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array 𝑛
 and the numbers 𝑙
 and 𝑟
, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array.

Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 109+7
 (i.e. the remainder when dividing by 109+7
). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print 0
.
