Polycarpus takes part in the "Field of Wonders" TV show. The participants of the show have to guess a hidden word as
fast as possible. Initially all the letters of the word are hidden.

The game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there
is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters. For example, if the
hidden word is "abacaba" and the player tells the letter "a", the host will reveal letters at all positions, occupied
by "a": 1, 3, 5 and 7 (positions are numbered from left to right starting from 1).

Polycarpus knows m words of exactly the same length as the hidden word. The hidden word is also known to him and appears
as one of these m words.

At current moment a number of turns have already been made and some letters (possibly zero) of the hidden word are
already revealed. Previously Polycarp has told exactly the letters which are currently revealed.

It is Polycarpus' turn. He wants to tell a letter in such a way, that the TV show host will assuredly reveal at least
one more letter. Polycarpus cannot tell the letters, which are already revealed.

Your task is to help Polycarpus and find out the number of letters he can tell so that the show host will assuredly
reveal at least one of the remaining letters.
