You are given 𝑛
 points on the 𝑥
 axis, at increasing positive integer coordinates 𝑥1<𝑥2<…<𝑥𝑛
.

For each pair (𝑖,𝑗)
 with 1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛
, you draw the segment [𝑥𝑖,𝑥𝑗]
. The segments are closed, i.e., a segment [𝑎,𝑏]
 contains the points 𝑎,𝑎+1,…,𝑏
.

You are given 𝑞
 queries. In the 𝑖
-th query, you are given a positive integer 𝑘𝑖
, and you have to determine how many points with integer coordinates are contained in exactly 𝑘𝑖
 segments.
