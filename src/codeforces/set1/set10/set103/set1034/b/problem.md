Little C loves number «3» very much. He loves all things about it.

Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size 𝑛×𝑚
. The cell in the 𝑥
-th row and in the 𝑦
-th column is called (𝑥,𝑦)
. Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly 3
. The Manhattan distance between two cells (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖)
 and (𝑥𝑗,𝑦𝑗)
 is defined as |𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑗|+|𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑗|
.

He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.
