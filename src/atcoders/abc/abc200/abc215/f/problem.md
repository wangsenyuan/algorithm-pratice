Given are 
N distinct points in a two-dimensional plane. Point 
i 
(1≤i≤N) has the coordinates 
(x 
i
​
 ,y 
i
​
 ).

Let us define the distance between two points 
i and 
j be 
min(∣x 
i
​
 −x 
j
​
 ∣,∣y 
i
​
 −y 
j
​
 ∣): the smaller of the difference in the 
x-coordinates and the difference in the 
y-coordinates.

Find the maximum distance between two different points.
