There are 𝑛
 cities and 𝑛−1
 two-way roads connecting pairs of cities in the kingdom. From any city, you can reach any other city by walking through some roads. The cities are numbered from 1
 to 𝑛
, and the city 1
 is the capital of the kingdom. So, the kingdom has a tree structure.

As the queen, Linova plans to choose exactly 𝑘
 cities developing industry, while the other cities will develop tourism. The capital also can be either industrial or tourism city.

A meeting is held in the capital once a year. To attend the meeting, each industry city sends an envoy. All envoys will follow the shortest path from the departure city to the capital (which is unique).

Traveling in tourism cities is pleasant. For each envoy, his happiness is equal to the number of tourism cities on his path.

In order to be a queen loved by people, Linova wants to choose 𝑘
 cities which can maximize the sum of happinesses of all envoys. Can you calculate the maximum sum for her?

 ### ideas
 1. 显然工业城市都在叶子节点上
 2. 可以反过来考虑，把哪些城市设置为旅游城市
 3. 对于一个节点而言，它的子节点越多，它越应该被设置为旅游城市
 4. 这是因为，可以在它的子节点中，放置足够多的工业城市，从而提高幸福度
 5. 如果，在某个节点v上设置工业城市，那么这整颗子树都应该被设置为工业城市
 6. 根据子树size排序，然后选择前n-k个节点
