After a trip with Sakurako, Kousuke was very scared because he forgot about his programming assignment. In this assignment, the teacher gave him an array 𝑎
 of 𝑛
 integers and asked him to calculate the number of non-overlapping segments of the array 𝑎
, such that each segment is considered beautiful.

A segment [𝑙,𝑟]
 is considered beautiful if 𝑎𝑙+𝑎𝑙+1+⋯+𝑎𝑟−1+𝑎𝑟=0
.

For a fixed array 𝑎
, your task is to compute the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.
