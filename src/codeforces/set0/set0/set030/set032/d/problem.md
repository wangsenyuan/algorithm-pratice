A star map in Berland is a checked field n × m squares. In each square there is or there is not a star. The favourite constellation of all Berland's astronomers is the constellation of the Cross. This constellation can be formed by any 5 stars so, that for some integer x (radius of the constellation) the following is true:

the 2nd is on the same vertical line as the 1st, but x squares up
the 3rd is on the same vertical line as the 1st, but x squares down
the 4th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st, but x squares left
the 5th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st, but x squares right
Such constellations can be very numerous, that's why they are numbered with integers from 1 on the following principle: when two constellations are compared, the one with a smaller radius gets a smaller index; if their radii are equal — the one, whose central star if higher than the central star of the other one; if their central stars are at the same level — the one, whose central star is to the left of the central star of the other one.

Your task is to find the constellation with index k by the given Berland's star map.
