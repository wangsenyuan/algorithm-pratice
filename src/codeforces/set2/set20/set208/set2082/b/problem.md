Ecrade has an integer 𝑥
. There are two kinds of operations.

Replace 𝑥
 with ⌊𝑥2⌋
, where ⌊𝑥2⌋
 is the greatest integer ≤𝑥2
.
Replace 𝑥
 with ⌈𝑥2⌉
, where ⌈𝑥2⌉
 is the smallest integer ≥𝑥2
.
Ecrade will perform exactly 𝑛
 first operations and 𝑚
 second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of 𝑥
 after 𝑛+𝑚
 operations. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!
