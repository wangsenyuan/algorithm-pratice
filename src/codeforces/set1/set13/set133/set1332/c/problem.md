Word ­ЮЉа
 of length ­ЮЉЏ
 is called ­ЮЉў
-complete if

­ЮЉа
 is a palindrome, i.e. ­ЮЉа­ЮЉќ=­ЮЉа­ЮЉЏ+1Рѕњ­ЮЉќ
 for all 1РЅц­ЮЉќРЅц­ЮЉЏ
;
­ЮЉа
 has a period of ­ЮЉў
, i.e. ­ЮЉа­ЮЉќ=­ЮЉа­ЮЉў+­ЮЉќ
 for all 1РЅц­ЮЉќРЅц­ЮЉЏРѕњ­ЮЉў
.
For example, "abaaba" is a 3
-complete word, while "abccba" is not.

Bob is given a word ­ЮЉа
 of length ­ЮЉЏ
 consisting of only lowercase Latin letters and an integer ­ЮЉў
, such that ­ЮЉЏ
 is divisible by ­ЮЉў
. He wants to convert ­ЮЉа
 to any ­ЮЉў
-complete word.

To do this Bob can choose some ­ЮЉќ
 (1РЅц­ЮЉќРЅц­ЮЉЏ
) and replace the letter at position ­ЮЉќ
 with some other lowercase Latin letter.

So now Bob wants to know the minimum number of letters he has to replace to convert ­ЮЉа
 to any ­ЮЉў
-complete word.

Note that Bob can do zero changes if the word ­ЮЉа
 is already ­ЮЉў
-complete.

You are required to answer ­ЮЉА
 test cases independently.
