Vasilije is a smart student and his discrete mathematics teacher Sonja taught him number theory very well.

He gave Ognjen a positive integer 𝑛
.

Denote 𝑑(𝑛)
as the number of positive integer divisors of 𝑛
, and denote 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎,𝑏)
as the largest integer 𝑔
such that 𝑎
is divisible by 𝑔
and 𝑏
is divisible by 𝑔
.

After that, he gave Ognjen 𝑞
queries, and there are 2
types of queries.

1
, 𝑥
— set 𝑛
to 𝑛⋅𝑥
, and then answer the following question: does there exist a positive integer 𝑎
such that 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎,𝑛)=1
, and 𝑑(𝑛⋅𝑎)=𝑛
?
2
— reset 𝑛
to its initial value (before any queries).
Note that 𝑛
does not get back to its initial value after the type 1 query.

Since Ognjen is afraid of number theory, Vasilije promised him that after each query, 𝑑(𝑛)≤109
, however, even with that constraint, he still needs your help with this problem.
