𝑇
  has the central symmetry: indeed, if 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦)
 covers (0,0)
 and (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 then 𝑃(𝑥−𝑥0,𝑦−𝑦0)
 covers (−𝑥0,−𝑦0)
 and (0,0)
. So the answer for polygons which don't have the sentral symmetry is NO. Let's prove if 𝑃
 has the central symmetry then the answer is YES. Translate 𝑃
 in such a way that the origin becomes its center of symmetry. Let's show that the homothety with the center at the origin and the coefficient 2
 transforms 𝑃
 into 𝑇
:

if a point (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 lies in 𝑃
, then 𝑃(𝑥0,𝑦0)
 covers both (0,0)
 and (2𝑥0,2𝑦0)
;
if a point (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 doesn't lie in 𝑃
, then consider a segment connecting the center of symmetry of the polygon 𝑃
 (also known as origin) and (𝑥0,𝑦0)
; it crosses some side of 𝑃
; WLOG, assume this side is parallel to the 𝑥
-axis and lies in the line 𝑦=𝑦1,𝑦1>0
 (otherwise we can rotate the plane). Since the polygon is convex, it completely lies in the stripe 𝑦∈[−𝑦1;𝑦1]
, that's why there isn't any vector which connects two points in 𝑃
 with a 𝑦
-coordinate greater than 2𝑦1
. Since 2𝑦0>2𝑦1
, there isn't any vector which connects two points in 𝑃
 with a 𝑦
-coordinate equal to 2𝑦0
, that's why the point (2𝑥0,2𝑦0)
 doesn't lie in 𝑇
.
To find whether a polygon has the central symmetry, check whether the midpoints of segments connecting the opposite vertexes coincide; if a polygon has an odd number of vertexes it can't have the central symmetry.
