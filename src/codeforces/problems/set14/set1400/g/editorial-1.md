We will use inclusion-exclusion formula to solve this problem (you may read about it here: https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/inclusion-exclusion.html). To put it simply, we are going to count the number of subsets that meet the restrictions on [𝑙𝑖,𝑟𝑖], ignoring the edges (I'll call the pairs of mercenaries that hate each other "edges" for simplicity). This number is not the answer, since we counted some subsets that violate the conditions for the edges — so, for each edge, we count the number of subsets that violate the condition on that edge, and subtract it from the answer. But it means that if a subset violates the conditions on multiple edges, we subtracted it multiple times, so, for each pair of edges, we count the subsets that violate both edges in that pair and add them back, then remove the subsets violating the triples, and so on. The mathematical formula for the answer is ∑𝐸∈𝑆𝑓(𝐸), where 𝑆 is the set containing all 2𝑚 subsets of edges, and 𝑓(𝐸) is the number of subsets that meet the constraints on [𝑙𝑖,𝑟𝑖], and violate the constraints for every edge 𝑒∈𝐸.

Now we have to calculate 𝑓(𝐸) efficiently, since the outer loop already runs in 𝑂(2𝑚). If we have to violate a set of edges, then we have a set of mercenaries that we should take (the "endpoints" of the edges), and the number of those mercenaries (let's denote it as 𝑘) is up to 40. The size of the subset should meet the constraints on [𝑙𝑖,𝑟𝑖] for each of those mercenaries, so let's intersect the segments [𝑙𝑖,𝑟𝑖] for them (and if the intersection is empty, then there are no subsets that violate all of those edges). Let the intersection of those segments be [𝐿,𝑅]. The naive solution would be to iterate on the size of the subset and calculate the number of ways to compose a subset that contains some fixed mercenaries of given size (if the size is 𝑠, and 𝑐𝑠 is the number of mercenaries that are willing to be in a subset of size 𝑠, then we have to add (𝑐𝑠−𝑘𝑠−𝑘) to the answer). So, for each subset 𝐸, 𝑓(𝐸)=∑𝑠=𝐿𝑅(𝑐𝑠−𝑘𝑠−𝑘). This sum can be calculated in 𝑂(1) as follows: note that 𝑘 is up to 40, so for every possible value of 𝑘, precalculate the array of prefix sums of those binomial coefficients. This precalculation runs in 𝑂(𝑛𝑚+𝑛log𝑀𝑂𝐷), and each 𝑓(𝐸) can be calculated in 𝑂(𝑚log𝑚), so overall the complexity is 𝑂(𝑛𝑚+𝑛log𝑀𝑂𝐷+2𝑚𝑚log𝑚).
