You are given an array of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that ai = ai - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 107). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 300).
