You are given a binary string of length𝑛
(i.e. a string consisting of𝑛
symbols ' 0 ' and ' 1 ').

In one move you can swap two adjacent characters in a string. What is the lexicographically minimal string you can get from a given string if you can do no more than𝑘
moves? It is possible that you will not make a single move.

Note that you can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices𝑖
And𝑖 + 1
any (possibly zero) number of times. Each such exchange is a separate move.

You need to answer𝑞
independent sets of input data.
