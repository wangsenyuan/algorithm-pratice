Tomorrow Ann takes the hardest exam of programming where she should get an excellent mark.

On the last theoretical class the teacher introduced the notion of a half-palindrome.

String t is a half-palindrome, if for all the odd positions i () the following condition is held: ti = t|t| - i + 1, where |t| is the length of string t if positions are indexed from 1. For example, strings "abaa", "a", "bb", "abbbaa" are half-palindromes and strings "ab", "bba" and "aaabaa" are not.

Ann knows that on the exam she will get string s, consisting only of letters a and b, and number k. To get an excellent mark she has to find the k-th in the lexicographical order string among all substrings of s that are half-palyndromes. Note that each substring in this order is considered as many times as many times it occurs in s.

The teachers guarantees that the given number k doesn't exceed the number of substrings of the given string that are half-palindromes.

Can you cope with this problem?
