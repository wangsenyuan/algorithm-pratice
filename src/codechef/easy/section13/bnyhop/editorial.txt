Number of sequences ending at node ii = 1(sequence - {ii}) + number of sequences ending in node jj such that A_j > A_iA
j
​
 >A
i
​
  and jj is in subtree in of ii or jj is ancestor of ii

This can be done in the following way
Find the eulerian tour of the tree. Maintain two fenwick trees on the eulerian tour of tree.
Traverse the nodes of the the tree in the decreasing order of A_iA
i
​
 .

In the first fenwick tree maintain number of sequences ending at ii at it’s start position of euler tour.
In the second fenwick tree maintain number of sequences ending at ii at it’s start position of euler tour, -1*number of sequences ending at ii at it’s end position of euler tour

For processing ii i.e., finding no of sequences ending at ii
number of sequences ending at subtree of ii = sum of values stored in first fenwick tree from start, end positions of ii.
number of sequences ending at ancestor of ii = sum of values stores in second fenwick tree from position 1 to start position of ii

Final answer will be sum of values stored in first fenwick tree;
