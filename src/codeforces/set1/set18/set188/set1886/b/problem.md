Monocarp tries to get home from work. He is currently at the point 𝑂=(0,0)
of a two-dimensional plane; his house is at the point 𝑃=(𝑃𝑥,𝑃𝑦)
.

Unfortunately, it is late in the evening, so it is very dark. Monocarp is afraid of the darkness. He would like to go
home along a path illuminated by something.

Thankfully, there are two lanterns, located in the points 𝐴=(𝐴𝑥,𝐴𝑦)
and 𝐵=(𝐵𝑥,𝐵𝑦)
. You can choose any non-negative number 𝑤
and set the power of both lanterns to 𝑤
. If a lantern's power is set to 𝑤
, it illuminates a circle of radius 𝑤
centered at the lantern location (including the borders of the circle).

You have to choose the minimum non-negative value 𝑤
for the power of the lanterns in such a way that there is a path from the point 𝑂
to the point 𝑃
which is completely illuminated. You may assume that the lanterns don't interfere with Monocarp's movement.
