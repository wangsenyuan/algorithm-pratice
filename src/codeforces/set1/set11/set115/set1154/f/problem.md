There are 𝑛
shovels in the nearby shop. The 𝑖
-th shovel costs 𝑎𝑖
bourles.

Misha has to buy exactly 𝑘
shovels. Each shovel can be bought no more than once.

Misha can buy shovels by several purchases. During one purchase he can choose any subset of remaining (non-bought) shovels and buy this subset.

There are also 𝑚
special offers in the shop. The 𝑗
-th of them is given as a pair (𝑥𝑗,𝑦𝑗)
, and it means that if Misha buys exactly 𝑥𝑗
shovels during one purchase then 𝑦𝑗
most cheapest of them are for free (i.e. he will not pay for 𝑦𝑗
most cheapest shovels during the current purchase).

Misha can use any offer any (possibly, zero) number of times, but he cannot use more than one offer during one purchase (but he can buy shovels without using any offers).

Your task is to calculate the minimum cost of buying 𝑘
shovels, if Misha buys them optimally.
