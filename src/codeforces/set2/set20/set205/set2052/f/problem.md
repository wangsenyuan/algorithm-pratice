Archimedes conducted his famous experiments on buoyancy. But not everyone knows that while he was taking a bath, he was too focused and didn't notice the moment when the water overflowed over the edge of the bath and flooded the floor near the wall. His expensive parquet was irreversibly damaged!

Archimedes noticed that not all was lost, and there were still several undamaged parquet pieces. The parquet near the wall had the shape of a long narrow stripe of 2×𝑛
 cells. Archimedes had an unlimited supply of 1×2
 parquet pieces that could be placed parallel or perpendicular to the wall. Archimedes didn't want to cut the parquet pieces. As a great scientist, he figured out that there was exactly one way to restore the parquet by filling the damaged area of the parquet with the non-overlapping 1×2
 cell shaped pieces.

Help historians to check Archimedes' calculations. For the given configuration of the 2×𝑛
 parquet floor, determine whether there is exactly one way to fill the damaged parquet cells with the 1×2
 cell parquet pieces. If Archimedes was wrong, find out whether there are multiple ways to restore the parquet, or there are no ways at all.
