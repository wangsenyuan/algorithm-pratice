You are given an array 𝑎
of 𝑛
integers. Find the number of pairs (𝑖,𝑗)
(1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛
) where the sum of 𝑎𝑖+𝑎𝑗
is greater than or equal to 𝑙
and less than or equal to 𝑟
(that is, 𝑙≤𝑎𝑖+𝑎𝑗≤𝑟
).

For example, if 𝑛=3
, 𝑎=[5,1,2]
, 𝑙=4
and 𝑟=7
, then two pairs are suitable:

𝑖=1
and 𝑗=2
(4≤5+1≤7
);
𝑖=1
and 𝑗=3
(4≤5+2≤7
).
