Gargari got bored to play with the bishops and now, after solving the problem about them, he is trying to do math
homework. In a math book he have found k permutations. Each of them consists of numbers 1, 2, ..., n in some order. Now
he should find the length of the longest common subsequence of these permutations. Can you help Gargari?
