The Cybermen solved that first test much quicker than the Daleks. Luckily for us, the Daleks were angry (shocking!) and they destroyed some of the Cybermen.

After the fighting stopped, Heidi gave them another task to waste their time on.

There are 𝑛
 points on a plane. Given a radius 𝑟
, find the maximum number of points that can be covered by an 𝐿1
-ball with radius 𝑟
.

An 𝐿1
-ball with radius 𝑟
 and center (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 in a 2D-plane is defined as the set of points (𝑥,𝑦)
 such that the Manhattan distance between (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 and (𝑥,𝑦)
 is at most 𝑟
.

Manhattan distance between (𝑥0,𝑦0)
 and (𝑥,𝑦)
 is defined as |𝑥−𝑥0|+|𝑦−𝑦0|
.
