Valentin participates in a show called "Shockers". The rules are quite easy: jury selects one letter which Valentin
doesn't know. He should make a small speech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter, he
receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected, but for each incorrect guess he receives an
electric shock too. The show ends when Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly.

Valentin can't keep in mind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can be uniquely
determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric shocks are those which Valentin got after the moment
the selected letter can be uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric shocks.
