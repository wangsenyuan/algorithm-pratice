Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left
and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is
needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden
bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).
