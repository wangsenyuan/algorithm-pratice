It is Bubble Cup finals season and farmer Johnny Bubbles must harvest his bubbles. The bubbles are in a rectangular bubblefield formed of 𝑁
 x 𝑀
 square parcels divided into 𝑁
 rows and 𝑀
 columns. The parcel in 𝑖𝑡ℎ
 row and 𝑗𝑡ℎ
 column yields 𝐴𝑖,𝑗
 bubbles.

Johnny Bubbles has available a very special self-driving bubble harvester that, once manually positioned at the beginning of a row or column, automatically harvests all the bubbles in that row or column. Once the harvester reaches the end of the row or column it stops and must be repositioned. The harvester can pass through any parcel any number of times, but it can collect bubbles from the parcel only once.

Johnny is very busy farmer, so he is available to manually position the harvester at most four times per day. Johnny is also impatient, so he wants to harvest as many bubbles as possible on the first day.

Please help Johnny to calculate what is the maximum number of bubbles he can collect on the first day.



### ideas
1. 分情况
2. 如果全部是行、列，那么找出最大的4个数即可
3. 如果行列交叉，就需要仔细考虑了
4. (1, 3) (3, 1)处理起来也容易
5. 剩下的(2, 2)要怎么处理呢？
6. n * m <= 1e5, 那么假设n < m, 那么 n < 300
7. 那么迭代列, 并且维护dp[i][j] 表示到当前列为止，已经选中一行时的最大值
8. 处理当前列，就是找到两行i, j， dp[i][j] - a[i][c] - a[j][c] 最大值
9. 然后也可以用当前列去更新即可
10. 那么这样子的复杂性 = n * m * n = 1e5 * 300 = 3 * 1e7 貌似可以
