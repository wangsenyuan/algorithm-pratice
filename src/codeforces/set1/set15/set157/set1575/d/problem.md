Mr. Chanek has an integer represented by a string 𝑠
. Zero or more digits have been erased and are denoted by the character _. There are also zero or more digits marked by the character X, meaning they're the same digit.

Mr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer 𝑠
, where 𝑠
 is divisible by 25
. Of course, 𝑠
 must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character _ with any digit. He can also replace the character X with any digit, but it must be the same for every character X.

As a note, a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, 0025 has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, (0 has no leading zero, but 0000 has three leading zeroes).
