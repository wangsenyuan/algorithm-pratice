You are given a table 𝑎
of size 2×𝑛
(i.e. two rows and 𝑛
columns) consisting of integers from 1
to 𝑛
.

In one move, you can choose some column 𝑗
(1≤𝑗≤𝑛
) and swap values 𝑎1,𝑗
and 𝑎2,𝑗
in it. Each column can be chosen no more than once.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain permutations of size 𝑛
in both first and second rows of the table or determine if it is impossible to do that.

You have to answer 𝑡
independent test cases.

Recall that the permutation of size 𝑛
is such an array of size 𝑛
that contains each integer from 1
to 𝑛
exactly once (the order of elements doesn't matter).
