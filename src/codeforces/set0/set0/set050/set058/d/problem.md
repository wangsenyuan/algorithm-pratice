BerOilGasDiamondBank has branches in n cities, at that n is an even number. The bank management wants to publish a calendar with the names of all those cities written in two columns: the calendar should consist of exactly n / 2 lines of strictly equal length, each of which contains exactly two names and exactly one separator character between them. The name of every city should be used in the calendar exactly once. For historical reasons the symbol d is used as the separator of words in the calendar.

The BerOilGasDiamondBank management wants to show that all its branches are equally important to it, that's why the order of their appearance in the calendar should be following: if we "glue"(concatinate) all the n / 2 calendar lines (from top to bottom) to make a single line, then the lexicographically minimal line is obtained. No separator character will be used to separate calendar lines. For example, if the lines are "bertown!berville", "newberville!bera", then the resulting line is "bertown!bervillenewberville!bera". In some sense one has to find the lexicographically minimal calendar, where the comparison of calendars happens line by line.

Help BerOilGasDiamondBank and construct the required calendar.
