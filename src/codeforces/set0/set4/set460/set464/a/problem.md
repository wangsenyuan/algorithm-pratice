Paul hates palindromes. He assumes that string s is tolerable if each its character is one of the first p letters of the
English alphabet and s doesn't contain any palindrome contiguous substring of length 2 or more.

Paul has found a tolerable string s of length n. Help him find the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same
length or else state that such string does not exist.
