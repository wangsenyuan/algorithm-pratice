The little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.

One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of 𝑛
 elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are 𝑞
 queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers 𝑙𝑖
, 𝑟𝑖
 (1≤𝑙𝑖≤𝑟𝑖≤𝑛)
. You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from 𝑙𝑖
 to 𝑟𝑖
, inclusive.

The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.
