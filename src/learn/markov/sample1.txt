Random numbers are generated by a Source. Top-level functions, such as Float64 and Int, use a default shared Source that produces a deterministic sequence of values each time a program is run. Use the Seed function to initialize the default Source if different behavior is required for each run. The default Source is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines, but Sources created by NewSource are not
JSX tree and renders it as a large object. So, instead of directly modifying attributes on HTML elements like Angular or Vue, React uses an object syntax to track changes that need to be made to the DOM and updates them in bulk. This works just fine in most cases. Our dialog’s open attribute is bound to its property and will respond perfectly well to changing props.The most obvious means of adding custom event listeners in React is by using DOM refs. In this model, we can reference our HTML node directly. The syntax is a bit verbose, but works great:
There are a number of great tools for authoring your own custom elements. Searching through npm reveals a multitude of tools for creating highly-reactive custom elements (including my own pet project), but the most popular today by far is lit-html from the Polymer team and, more specifically for Web Components, LitElement.
LitElement is a custom elements base class that provides a series of APIs for doing all of the things we’ve walked through so far. It can be run in a browser without a build step, but if you enjoy using future-facing tools like decorators, there are utilities for that as well.Before diving into how to use lit or LitElement, take a minute to familiarize yourself with tagged template literals, which are a special kind of function called on template literal strings in JavaScript. These functions take in an array of strings and a collection of interpolated values and can return anything you might want.
