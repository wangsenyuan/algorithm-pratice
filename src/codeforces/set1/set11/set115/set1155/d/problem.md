You are given an array 𝑎
 consisting of 𝑛
 integers. Beauty of array is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray of this array (this subarray may be empty). For example, the beauty of the array [10, -5, 10, -4, 1] is 15, and the beauty of the array [-3, -5, -1] is 0.

You may choose at most one consecutive subarray of 𝑎
 and multiply all values contained in this subarray by 𝑥
. You want to maximize the beauty of array after applying at most one such operation.
