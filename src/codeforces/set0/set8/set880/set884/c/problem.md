The construction of subway in Bertown is almost finished! The President of Berland will visit this city soon to look at
the new subway himself.

There are n stations in the subway. It was built according to the Bertown Transport Law:

For each station i there exists exactly one train that goes from this station. Its destination station is pi, possibly
pi = i;
For each station i there exists exactly one station j such that pj = i.
The President will consider the convenience of subway after visiting it. The convenience is the number of ordered
pairs (x, y) such that person can start at station x and, after taking some subway trains (possibly zero), arrive at
station y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n).

The mayor of Bertown thinks that if the subway is not convenient enough, then the President might consider installing a
new mayor (and, of course, the current mayor doesn't want it to happen). Before President visits the city mayor has
enough time to rebuild some paths of subway, thus changing the values of pi for not more than two subway stations. Of
course, breaking the Bertown Transport Law is really bad, so the subway must be built according to the Law even after
changes.

The mayor wants to do these changes in such a way that the convenience of the subway is maximized. Help him to calculate
the maximum possible convenience he can get!
