You are given a forest — an undirected graph with 𝑛
 vertices such that each its connected component is a tree.

The diameter (aka "longest shortest path") of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.

You task is to add some edges (possibly zero) to the graph so that it becomes a tree and the diameter of the tree is minimal possible.

If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.
