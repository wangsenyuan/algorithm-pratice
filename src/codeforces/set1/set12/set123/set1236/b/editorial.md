The answer is (2𝑚−1)𝑛
.

If we consider each present, it may contain only in the first box, in the second ... both in the first and second box,
in the first and the third one ... in the first,the second and the third one ... There are 2𝑚−1
ways.

There are 𝑛
presents, so there are (2𝑚−1)𝑛
ways in total according to the Multiplication Principle.
