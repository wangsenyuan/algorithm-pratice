You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of 𝑛
 vertices and 𝑚
 edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label 1
 on it) is equal to 𝐷
 (or say that there are no such spanning trees). Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
