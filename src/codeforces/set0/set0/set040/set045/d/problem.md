On a history lesson the teacher asked Vasya to name the dates when n famous events took place. He doesn't remembers the exact dates but he remembers a segment of days [li, ri] (inclusive) on which the event could have taken place. However Vasya also remembers that there was at most one event in one day. Help him choose such n dates of famous events that will fulfill both conditions. It is guaranteed that it is possible.


### ideas
1. 尽量先安排li越小的任务，在li相同时，安排ri越小的任务
