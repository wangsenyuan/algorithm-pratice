In the long-forgotten halls of Kombinatoria's ancient academy, a gifted mathematician named Kim is faced with an unusual
challenge. They found an old sequence of integers, which is believed to be a cryptic message from the legendary
Kombinatoria's Oracle, and Kim wants to decipher its hidden meaning.

Kim's mission is to find specific patterns within the sequence, known as Harmonious Subsequences. These are
extraordinary subsequences where the sum of every three consecutive numbers is even, and each subsequence must be at
least three numbers in length.

Given a sequence 𝑎𝑖
(1≤𝑖≤𝑛
) of length 𝑛
, its subsequence of length 𝑚
is equal to 𝑎𝑏1,𝑎𝑏2,…,𝑎𝑏𝑚
and is uniquely defined by a set of 𝑚
indices 𝑏𝑗
, such that 1≤𝑏1<𝑏2<…<𝑏𝑚≤𝑛
. Subsequences given by different sets of indices 𝑏𝑗
are considered different.

There's a twist in Kim's quest: the number of these Harmonious Subsequences could be overwhelming. To report the
findings effectively, Kim must calculate the total number of these subsequences, presenting the answer as a remainder
after dividing by the number 998244353
.
