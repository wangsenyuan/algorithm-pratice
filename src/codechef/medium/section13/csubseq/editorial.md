Chef has a string S with length N. As Chef really likes his name, he defines the chefness of a string as the number of ways to find the string "chef" as a subsequence in S; formally, it's the number of ways to choose four indices i, j, k, l such that Si = 'c', Sj = 'h', Sk = 'e', Sl = 'f' and 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k ≤ l ≤ N. For example, the chefness of "chehefc" is 3 (with subsequences given by indices (1, 2, 3, 6), (1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 4, 5, 6)).

Chef perfectly understands that people really don't like strings with chefness greater than K. Therefore, he wants to erase a number of characters (possibly zero) from S in order to obtain a string with chefness equal to K. Help him compute the minimum number of characters he has to erase in order to achieve that!
